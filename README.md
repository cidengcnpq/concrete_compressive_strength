# Comparison of machine learning techniques to predict the compressive strength of concrete

This is an Undergrad Research Project developed at the Federal University of Ouro Preto with the goal of predicting the compressive strength of concrete. 
Tecnologias Utilizadas: Python, Pandas, Sklearn, Tensorflow, XGBoost, Matplotlib.

The training database was extracted from I. C. Yeh, "Modeling of strength of high-performance concrete using artificial neural networks," Cement and Concrete research, pp. 1797-1808, 1998.

The validation database was gathered by the authors. If you want to use it, please cite the article "Comparison of machine learning techniques to predict the compressive strength of concrete and considerations on model generalization" from IBRACON Structures and Materials Journal.
